Overview:
This project aims to tackle the intricate challenge of detecting sarcasm in social media linguistics. Recognising the potential pitfalls in the field due to varied language use and inconsistent data collection methods, this research uses a BERT-based training approach to enhance sarcasm detection's generalisability across diverse data collection strategies.

## Contents:
Supplementary Documents- Datasets: Contains links to access/download all datasets used in the study. (Reddit, Twitter, Headlines and English Sarcasm)

Datasets: Contains csv or json files for all datasets excluding the Reddit dataset which is too large.

Dataset EDA: Folder containing the dataset EDA's for the datasets.

Dataset Selection Models: Folder containing notebooks for all 10 dataset selection models.

Data Pre-processing Models: Folder containing notebooks for all 6 data pre-processing models.

Fine-tuning models: Folder containing 2 Fine-tuning models including the Final tuned model.
